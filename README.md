# minesweeper-js
My second attempt at creating Minesweeper, this time using Javascript!

Play the game at http://babbage.cs.missouri.edu/~pg3f4/ms.php

The to-do list for this is long. The game is mostly bug-free, but it runs into some killer performance issues when the grid gets too big.
There is also a lot of extemporaneous code that needs to be removed. For the web class that this was made for, a whole log-in system was
required, and extra code from that is still hanging around. Still, the code is working, and is free to a good home.
